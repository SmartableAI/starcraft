title: "StarCraft 2: THE MID-GAME BUNKER \"RUSH\"! (PartinG vs Cure)"
excerpt: "A really fun series of professional StarCraft 2 between PartinG and Cure. In this best-of-3 we see a variety of openers from both players and in two of them, Cure goes for a timing attack where he's building structures like Bunkers on his opponent's side of the map.
